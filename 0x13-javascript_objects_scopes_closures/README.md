## Task 0: Rectangle #0

An empty class `Rectangle` defined using the class notation.

## Task 1: Rectangle #1

A class `Rectangle` that takes two arguments `w` and `h` in the constructor and initializes the instance attributes `width` and `height`.

## Task 2: Rectangle #2

A class `Rectangle` that takes two arguments `w` and `h` in the constructor and initializes the instance attributes `width` and `height`. Handles cases where `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer.

## Task 3: Rectangle #3

A class `Rectangle` that takes two arguments `w` and `h` in the constructor and initializes the instance attributes `width` and `height`. Handles cases where `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer. Includes an instance method `print()` to print the rectangle.

## Task 4: Rectangle #4

A class `Rectangle` that takes two arguments `w` and `h` in the constructor and initializes the instance attributes `width` and `height`. Handles cases where `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer. Includes instance methods `print()`, `rotate()`, and `double()`.

## Task 5: Square #0

A class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle`. Handles square-specific properties.

## Task 6: Square #1

A class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from itself. Includes an instance method `charPrint(c)` to print the square using the character `c`.

## Task 7: Occurrences

A function that returns the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.

## Task 8: Esrever

A function that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in method `reverse`.

## Task 9: Log me

A function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

## Task 10: Number conversion

A function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

## Task 100: Array Imports and Mapping

A script that imports an array and computes a new array using the `map` function.

## Task 101: Sorted Occurrences

A script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.

## Task 102: Concat Files

A script that concatenates the contents of two files and writes the result to a third file.

Feel free to explore each task for more details and implementation.
