# JavaScript Warm-Up Projects

This repository contains a series of JavaScript warm-up projects that cover a variety of basic and advanced JavaScript concepts. These projects are intended for practice and learning purposes.

## Requirements

- The code in this repository is intended to be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- All code files should end with a new line.
- The first line of each code file should be `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- Your code should adhere to the specified coding style (semistandard compliant, version 16.x.x) with semicolons on top.
- All code files must be executable.

9. **8-square.js**
   - Prints a square of "X" characters based on the size provided as the first argument.

10. **9-add.js**
    - Exports a function `add` that returns the addition of two integers.

11. **10-factorial.js**
    - Computes and prints the factorial of a number.

    - Modifies the value of `myVar` to 89 and then to 333.

14. **13-add.js**
    - Exports a function `add` for adding two integers. Used in 13-main.js.

15. **101-call_me_moby.js**
    - Exports a function `callMeMoby` that executes a function x times.

16. **102-add_me_maybe.js**
    - Exports a function `addMeMaybe` that increments and calls a function.

17. **103-object_fct.js**
    - Adds a new function `incr` to an object and demonstrates its usage.

## Running the Code

To run any of the JavaScript files, use the following command:

./filename.js


Replace `filename.js` with the name of the specific JavaScript file you want to execute.

Feel free to explore and learn from these projects! Happy coding!
