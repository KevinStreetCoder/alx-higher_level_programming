Project Timeline:
- Start: Jul 4, 2023 6:00 AM
- End: Jul 5, 2023 6:00 AM
- Checker release: Jul 4, 2023 12:00 PM
- Auto review launch: At the deadline

## Background Context
In this project, we dive deeper into Python's object-oriented programming and examine how Python treats different types of objects. We explore the concept of variables, object modification, and aliasing.

## Project Structure
- The project consists of questions about Python's specificity and expected results.
- The goal is to understand Python's behavior and reasoning behind the answers.
- Avoid relying solely on the Python interpreter; instead, read, think, and brainstorm with peers.
- Submit answers in a one-line format without any leading or trailing spaces.

## Resources
- [9.10. Objects and values](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#objects-values-and-types)
- [9.11. Aliasing](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
- [Immutable vs mutable types](https://thepythonguru.com/python-immutable-vs-mutable-objects/)
- [Mutation](https://thepythonguru.com/python-immutable-vs-mutable-objects/)
- [9.12. Cloning lists](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/shallow-deep-copy)
- [Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45049163/python-tuples-immutable-but-potentially-changing)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Define an object in Python
- Differentiate between a class and an object or instance
- Distinguish between immutable and mutable objects
- Define what a reference is
- Understand assignments and aliases
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
- Display the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython implementation
- Identify mutable and immutable objects in Python
- List built-in mutable types in Python
- List built-in immutable types in Python
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions
